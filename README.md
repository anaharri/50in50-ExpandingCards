# 50 PROJECTS IN 50 DAYS | HTML, CSS & JS

This is one of the 50 projects taught in Brad Traversy's course in Udemy.   

I had bought the course a while ago, when I was starting my journey in web development; however, as many of us do, I bought it along with several others, and I left it behind in hopes of finishing a more extensive one. Then I got into a coding bootcamp, learnt React, and never again worked with pure CSS and JS since.  

But recently, I've been reconnecting with my passion for frontend development and design, and understanding, more than ever, the importance of mastering the basics; so I decided to pick CSS and vanilla JS back up, starting Brad's course over from scratch. And let me tell you, I had a lot of fun creating this project; it was fast and simple, and a great way to dust off all those core concepts. Since it was so strongly based on images, I took the liberty of turning it into a bit of a vision board for my life, or a collection of a few of my favorite things :) 

I'm actually looking forward to creating another one tomorrow.  
Stay tuned!
